	'Why is my budget never fully reached?'=>"There is a mechanism in place on the RTB platform that is used to prevent over-spending on the system. Due to the speed at which traffic can be bought on the system, this mechanism effectively throttles a campaign once it approaches the end of the budget (i.e., when there is $5.00 left.) So if you notice that your daily budget is never fully reached, it is not for lack of traffic, but because of this safety buffer.<p> For this reason, if your total daily budget is equal to, or less than, $5.00, your campaign will not get any traffic.",

	'What is Average CPM?'=>"Average CPM is the average winning price observed on the SiteScout platform. Please note that this figure only reflects bid data on SiteScout, and that winning bid data from external platforms is not displayed.<p> In cases where the Average CPM is $0.00, it simply means that the system was unable to calculate an accurate average for that site, usually because no one has won traffic on it yet.

	'What is Default Bid vs. eCPM?'=>'The Default Bid column is the maximum CPM price that you are willing to pay for a given site.<p> The eCPM column reflects the actual CPM price that you are winning at, and paying.',

	'What are Impressions Bid vs. Impressions Won?'=>'The Impressions Bid column is displaying the amount of impressions that your specific campaign is bidding on, and that match your campaign targeting criteria. Impressions Bid is taking into consideration many factors, including the geo-region you are targeting, the banner sizes you added to your campaign, contextual targeting, audience targeting, device targeting, and every other filter you can apply to a campaign.<p> The Impressions Won column is displaying the amount of Impressions Bid that you have won. This is determined largely by your bid price and your frequency cap. Naturally, you only pay for Impressions Won.<p> The number of impressions you’ve won, over the number of impressions you’ve bid on, is known as your Win Rate (%).',

	'Frequency Cap: What is it? How does it work? What are best practices?'=>'Frequency cap defines how often you wish to display ads to the same user, within a given timeframe (usually every 24 hours.)<p> (Example: A frequency cap of 3 impressions per 12 hours means that each visitor will see your ads a maximum of 3 times within 12 hours.)<p> This process works via cookies, which are used to remember a visitor’s impression count. Our default setting of 3 times within 12 hours is a great starting point.<p> For campaigns with the goal of brand awareness, increasing this number is a good idea. For performance or direct response campaigns, keeping the frequency cap between 1 and 3 is typically ideal.<p> From a performance perspective, increasing or decreasing your frequency cap may impact your CTR and conversion rate (CR), which is why a balance must be found between banner burnout (oversaturation) and performance.',
